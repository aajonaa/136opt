# The APDPLO.m is the PLO variant which introduce the strategy from paper: Adaptive distance-based multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm with simple position update -- By chatgpt and then by QwQ2.5Max, which superior than the original PLO -- at least the QwQ2.5Max have some usage.
# The APDPLO_EABC.m is introduced another strategy from paper: EABC-AS: Elite-driven artificial bee colony algorithm with adaptive population scaling, which is developed by Grok3 -- the best model in the world. And the comparison is benchmark on CEC2020, the ration of it and the PLO is 1.3 and 1.7. So this is the end of the development of the algorithm for the paper with the timeline of 2025-3-15.
