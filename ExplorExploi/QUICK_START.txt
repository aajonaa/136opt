ExplorExploi - Quick Start Guide
======================================================================

FOLDER CONTENTS:
----------------
✓ Main script: exp_CCMWOA1.m
✓ Algorithms: LRRIME and RIME
✓ All utility functions
✓ CEC benchmark functions (2005, 2013, 2014, 2017, 2019)
✓ Required data files
✓ Output directory

HOW TO USE:
-----------
1. Open MATLAB
2. Navigate to the ExplorExploi folder
3. Run: exp_CCMWOA1

VERIFY SETUP (OPTIONAL):
------------------------
Before running the main experiment, you can verify all dependencies:
   >> test_dependencies

This will check that all required files are present and working.

WHAT THE MAIN SCRIPT DOES:
--------------------------
- Compares LRRIME vs RIME algorithms
- Tests on CEC2017 benchmark functions (F107-F136)
- Runs 30 independent trials per function
- Generates convergence curves, balance plots, and diversity plots
- Performs statistical analysis
- Saves all results to exp_result folder

OUTPUT FILES:
-------------
Results are saved in: exp_result/LRRIME-[timestamp]/
- Excel file with statistics and rankings
- Convergence curve figures (.fig and .tif)
- Balance analysis figures (.fig and .tif)
- Diversity analysis figures (.fig and .tif)

CUSTOMIZATION:
--------------
To modify the experiment, edit exp_CCMWOA1.m:
- Line 9:  SearchAgents_no (population size)
- Line 12: dim (problem dimension)
- Line 14: algorithmName (algorithms to compare)
- Line 16: Flod (number of independent runs)
- Line 63: Function_name_all (which functions to test)

NOTES:
------
- This folder is completely self-contained
- Can be moved or copied to any location
- Works on Windows with MATLAB (MEX files compiled for Windows)
- Uses parallel processing for faster execution
